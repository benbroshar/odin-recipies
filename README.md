# odin-recipies
First Full Website, recipe lists


For this website I am pulling together all of the basic skills I have learned so far in The Odin Project fundamentals. I will have a webpage with a landing site, and links to multiple different recipes all hosted on the same site. There will be pictures of the dish at the top so users can easily see what their finished meal should look like.
